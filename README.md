# 4-BIT-GRAY-CODE-COUNTER-USING-VHDL
A Gray code counter which has an iterative and relatively simple structure is described. The code is shown to be the reflected binary Gray code, implying simple conversion of the count into binary code. A Gray Code is an encoding of integers as sequences of bits with the property that the representations of adjacent integers differ in exactly one binary position. Gray Codes have many practical applications that go beyond research interests. Counter is a digital device and the output of the counter includes a predefined state based on the clock pulse applications. The output of the counter can be used to count the number of pulses. Generally, counters consist of a flip-flop arrangement which can be synchronous counter or asynchronous counter. Counters have a primary function of producing a specified output sequence and are thus sometimes referred to as pattern generators
